## 📚 DevOps Learning Roadmap  

I’m documenting my DevOps journey step by step. Each “Day” links to a hands-on project or notes.  

### ✅ Completed  

- **Day 1 – Linux Fundamentals**  
  🔹 Learned essential commands (navigation, files, logs, permissions).  
  🔹 Project: [System Activity Logger](https://github.com/abhisheksharma9731/system-activity-logger)  

- **Day 2 – Git & GitHub**  
  🔹 Mastered Git basics (branching, merging, reverting).  
  🔹 Learned GitHub collaboration (repos, forks, PRs, issues).  
  🔹 Repo: *Hands-on Git collaboration examples*  

- **Day 3 – Shell Scripting**  
  🔹 Project: [Basic Backup Script](https://github.com/abhisheksharma9731/bash-backup-script)  
  🔹 Learned defensive Bash scripting (`set -euo pipefail`).  

- **Day 3+ – Advanced Bash Project**  
  🔹 Project: [Advanced Backup Script](https://github.com/abhisheksharma9731/advanced-backup-script)  
  🔹 Added **retention policy** (delete old backups) + **alerting** on failure.   

- **Day 4 – Docker Basics & Project**
  ### 🚀 Docker + CI/CD Project
- Containerized a simple web app with Docker.
- Created a `Dockerfile` and published image to **Docker Hub**.
- Automated the build & push process using **GitHub Actions**:
  - Configured `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.
  - Added GitHub secrets for Docker Hub authentication.
  - Published images tagged as `latest` and with `git commit SHA`.
- [View Repository](https://github.com/abhisheksharma9731/docker-demo) | [Docker Hub Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/abhisheksharma9731/docker-demo)


### ✅ Completed  
- [x] Mastered Linux basics & shell scripting  
- [x] Built and managed AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, etc.)  
- [x] Automated infrastructure with Terraform & Ansible  
- [x] Created and optimized CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions & Azure DevOps
