# Hi, I'm Abhishek Sharma 👋

🚀 **Application Support & DevOps Engineer** | Cloud | Automation | CI/CD | Containers

I’m passionate about building, automating, and scaling systems with **Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Cloud technologies**.  
This profile is my **learning + project roadmap**, showing how I’m growing step by step as a DevOps engineer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current Focus)
- **OS & Scripting:** Linux, Bash, Shell scripting
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Containers:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL
- **Cloud (Learning):** AWS, Azure

## 🚀 DevOps Learning Roadmap

### ✅ Completed
- **Linux Basics** → File system, process management, shell scripting
- **Git & GitHub** → Version control, repositories, GitHub profile setup
- **Shell Scripting Project** → `backup.sh` with logging, error handling, and automation
- **Docker Basics** → Containerization, Docker Hub publishing, GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Docker Compose Project** → Multi-container setup with:
  - Flask app + PostgreSQL
  - `docker-compose.yml` for orchestration
  - GitHub Actions workflow for CI (`compose-ci.yml`)
  - DockerHub publishing workflow (`docker-publish.yml`)
  - Health check endpoints (`/` and `/db`) to test app + DB connectivity

### 🔜 Next
- Kubernetes (local setup with Minikube, deployments, services)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform on AWS/Azure)
- CI/CD Pipelines (Azure DevOps, Jenkins)
- Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
